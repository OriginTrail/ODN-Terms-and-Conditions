# TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ORIGINTRAIL DECENTRALIZED NETWORK - ORIGINTRAIL V4 FREEDOM-GEMINI NETWORK

## INTRODUCTION

The OriginTrail Decentralized Network (hereinafter referred to as &quot;ODN&quot; or &quot;OriginTrail v4 Freedom-Gemini Network&quot;) is a neutral, peer-to-peer network for supply chain data sharing with an open-source implementation of a network node developed by OriginTrail, digitalne rešitve za dobavne verige, d.o.o., located at Vojkova cesta 63, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, identification number: 8088314000, tax number: SI 62600095, a company organized and established under the laws of Slovenia (hereinafter referred to as &quot;OriginTrail&quot;).

The OriginTrail v4 Freedom-Gemini Network is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0. You may obtain a copy of the License at [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The ODN consists of different test networks (hereinafter referred to as &quot;testnets&quot;) and a main network (hereinafter referred to as &quot;mainnet&quot;). The testnets of ODN enable users to get familiar with the technology before using the ODN mainnet.

The ODN mainnet started with the Vostok stage, the first installment of the mainnet&#39;s technological life. The Vostok stage was the first contact of the ODN with real market conditions as the Trace token (TRAC) has been used for network utility ever since. Following Vostok, the v4 Freedom-Gemini stage, to which these terms and conditions apply, kicked in on 26 December 2019, with initial litigation and reputation mechanisms implemented in real market conditions, opening up the network for all participants.

The next Freedom-Gemini stage introduced additional data handling and privacy capabilities and focused on bridging different technological systems where it is important to ease integration with enterprise software. Finally, the Pioneer stage will kick in with further data tokenization abilities. More information on the mainnet roadmap will be published on the website roadmap page, available at https://origintrail.io/roadmap.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NEXT PIONEER STAGE IS THE AIM TOWARDS WHICH ORIGINTRAIL STRIVES AS A DEVELOPER OF THE ODN. HOWEVER, BY USING THE ODN, YOU FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ORIGINTRAIL SHALL NOT BE IN ANY WAY HELD LIABLE FOR THEIR REALIZATION AND PERFORMANCE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY SOLELY TO THE V4 FREEDOM-GEMINI NETWORK STAGE AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES. PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DO NOT GOVERN THE USE OF ANY OTHER STAGE OF THE NETWORK, EXCEPT THE USE OF THE v4 FREEDOM-GEMINI NETWORK NODE.

PLEASE NOTE THAT TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION, AVAILABLE AT [HTTP://DOCS.ORIGINTRAIL.IO/](http://docs.origintrail.io/), CONSTITUTES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

If you have any questions related to the functionalities and use of the OriginTrail v4 Freedom-Gemini Network node, please contact us via email at [tech@origin-trail.com](mailto:tech@origin-trail.com).
