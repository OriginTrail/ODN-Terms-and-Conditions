The DKG comprises various test networks (hereinafter referred to as “testnets”) and a main network (hereinafter referred to as “mainnet”). The testnets enable users to familiarize themselves with the technology before utilizing the mainnet.

The mainnet’s evolution included several previous versions:
- **Vostok Stage**: The initial phase of the mainnet’s technological lifecycle.
- **Freedom-Gemini Stage (v4)**: Launched on December 26, 2019, this stage introduced initial litigation and reputation mechanisms in real market conditions, opening the network to all participants.
- **Version 5 (V5)**: Released on March 23, 2021, enabling multichain DKG.
- **Version 6 (V6)**: Released on December 15, 2022, bringing neuro-symbolic AI enhancements.
- **Version 8 (V8)**: The latest iteration, introducing significant advancements such as DKG Edge Nodes, which expand the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) capabilities, enabling anyone to run DKG-enabled trusted AI on their devices, thereby preserving privacy and opening new opportunities for builders.

More information on the DKG mainnet roadmap is available at [https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap](https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap)

## 1.11 DELEGATED STAKING

Delegated staking enables users to delegate TRAC tokens to nodes within the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (hereinafter referred to as the “DKG”). The staked tokens act as collateral, ensuring the security and quality of node operations. Upon delegating TRAC tokens to a node, the tokens are locked in a smart contract, and a proportional amount of stake shared is associated with the delegating wallet address in the associated smart contract. To withdraw your staked TRAC tokens, you must initiate the withdraw function in the same smart contract in which your TRAC tokens are locked.

More information about the delegation of TRAC tokens is available in the DKG Technical Documentation at [https://docs.origintrail.io](https://docs.origintrail.io).

Delegated staking operates in a permissionless environment and may be accessed either directly through smart contracts or via various interfaces. The primary interface supported and maintained by OriginTrail is the DKG Staking Dashboard, accessible at [https://staking.origintrail.io](https://staking.origintrail.io). Users are solely responsible for choosing the interface through which they access the delegated staking feature. If using the DKG Staking Dashboard, OriginTrail advises verifying the URL’s authenticity to avoid scams or phishing attempts.

As delegated staking operates in a decentralized and permissionless way, the DKG Staking Dashboard is designed never to access your funds. You are solely responsible for managing your wallet, private keys, and other sensitive information that may allow unauthorized access to your wallet.

The selection of a node to which you delegate TRAC tokens is entirely your responsibility. The choice of node may significantly impact the amount of network rewards you receive as a delegator. It is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with the network reward mechanics, detailed in the DKG Technical Documentation. If you do not fully understand the functioning of the reward system, it is advised to refrain from participating in delegated staking.
